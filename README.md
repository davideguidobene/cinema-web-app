## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
You can run the web app using Docker (recommended) or installing python and postgresql on your machine.

### With Docker
#### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

#### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.
